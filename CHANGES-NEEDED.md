# Changes Made to Fix Issues

## 1. Fixed Tanker Image Path Issue
- Added proper imports: `import fs from 'fs'; import path from 'path';`
- Added path resolution logic:
  ```javascript
  // Fix for assets path - resolve proper path based on environment
  const basePath = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? path.join(process.cwd()) : process.cwd();
  const TANKER_IMAGE_PATH = TANKER_IMAGE_URL ? 
    (TANKER_IMAGE_URL.startsWith('http') ? TANKER_IMAGE_URL : path.join(basePath, TANKER_IMAGE_URL)) : 
    path.join(basePath, './assets/tanker.png');
  ```
- Updated all references to use `TANKER_IMAGE_PATH` instead of `TANKER_IMAGE_URL`
- This resolves the path in both local development and Vercel production environments

## 2. Fixed "SCT" being treated as a truck number
- Added a reserved words list to prevent certain terms from being interpreted as truck IDs:
  ```javascript
  // Enhanced truck ID matching - more flexible but exclude keywords like SCT
  const reservedWords = ['SCT', 'ROW'];
  const truckIdMatch = text.match(/\b([A-Z]{2,4}\s*\d{3,4}\s*[A-Z]{0,2})\b/i);
  if (truckIdMatch && !reservedWords.includes(truckIdMatch[1].replace(/\s+/g, '').toUpperCase())) {
      query.truckId = truckIdMatch[1].replace(/\s+/g, ''); // Remove all spaces
  }
  ```

## 3. Add Gatepass to Summary (Manual Step Needed)
For both summary sections in the code (around lines 1217 and 1353), you need to manually:

1. Add the gatepass count calculation after the armedCount calculation:
   ```javascript
   const gatepassCount = trucks.filter(t => t.GATEPASS || t.gatepass).length;
   ```

2. Add the gatepass information to the summary output, after the total trucks line:
   ```javascript
   if (gatepassCount > 0) reply += `â€¢ Gatepass issued: ${gatepassCount}\n`;
   ```

## Testing Changes
After making these changes:
1. The tanker image should now load properly in both environments
2. "SCT" and "ROW" keywords will not be mistakenly treated as truck IDs
3. The summary will include gatepass information for multi-truck results

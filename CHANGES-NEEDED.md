# Changes Made to Fix Issues

## 1. Fixed Tanker Image Path Issue
- Added proper imports: `import fs from 'fs'; import path from 'path';`
- Added path resolution logic:
  ```javascript
  // Fix for assets path - resolve proper path based on environment
  const basePath = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? path.join(process.cwd()) : process.cwd();
  const TANKER_IMAGE_PATH = TANKER_IMAGE_URL ? 
    (TANKER_IMAGE_URL.startsWith('http') ? TANKER_IMAGE_URL : path.join(basePath, TANKER_IMAGE_URL)) : 
    path.join(basePath, './assets/tanker.png');
  ```
- Updated all references to use `TANKER_IMAGE_PATH` instead of `TANKER_IMAGE_URL`
- This resolves the path in both local development and Vercel production environments

## 2. Fixed "SCT" being treated as a truck number
- Added a reserved words list to prevent certain terms from being interpreted as truck IDs:
  ```javascript
  // Enhanced truck ID matching - more flexible but exclude keywords like SCT
  const reservedWords = ['SCT', 'ROW'];
  const truckIdMatch = text.match(/\b([A-Z]{2,4}\s*\d{3,4}\s*[A-Z]{0,2})\b/i);
  if (truckIdMatch && !reservedWords.includes(truckIdMatch[1].replace(/\s+/g, '').toUpperCase())) {
      query.truckId = truckIdMatch[1].replace(/\s+/g, ''); // Remove all spaces
  }
  ```

## 3. Add Gatepass to Summary (Manual Step Needed)
For both summary sections in the code (around lines 1217 and 1353), you need to manually:

1. Add the gatepass count calculation after the armedCount calculation:
   ```javascript
   const gatepassCount = trucks.filter(t => t.GATEPASS || t.gatepass).length;
   ```

2. Add the gatepass information to the summary output, after the total trucks line:
   ```javascript
   if (gatepassCount > 0) reply += `• Gatepass issued: ${gatepassCount}\n`;
   ```

## 4. ✅ NEW: Company Wizard System Added
A complete company-specific data access system with the following features:

### **Entry Command:**
- `CO Aran` or `CO <company>` - Enter company mode with access control

### **Company Commands (only work in company mode):**
- `status <truck>` - Check company truck status with driver details and PMS info
- `trucks` - List all company trucks with drivers and status
- `driver <name>` - Search for driver information within company
- `pms <truck>` - Check PMS schedule and maintenance status
- `fleet` - Company fleet summary with statistics
- `exit` - Return to main bot mode

### **Security Features:**
- ✅ Chat ID whitelist per company
- ✅ Session management with 30-minute timeout
- ✅ Admin access to all companies
- ✅ Access denied messages for unauthorized users

### **Session Management:**
- Users stay in company mode until they type `exit` or session expires
- Clear mode indicators in help and responses
- Separate command handling for company vs main mode

## Data Setup Required

### **1. Add Chat IDs to Company Access:**
In `api/bot.js`, update the `companyAccess` object:
```javascript
const companyAccess = {
  'aran': [123456789, 987654321], // Add actual Telegram chat IDs
  'mokpetro': [111222333],
  // Add more companies as needed
};
```

### **2. Backend API Endpoints Needed:**
Add these actions to your Google Apps Script backend:

- `getCompanyTrucks` - Returns all trucks for a company
- `getCompanyDriver` - Search drivers within company
- `getCompanyPMS` - Get PMS data for company truck
- `getCompanyFleetSummary` - Company fleet statistics
- `getCompanyTruckStatus` - Detailed truck status with company data

### **3. Data Storage Options:**
- **Option A:** Separate Google Sheets per company (e.g., `ARAN_TRUCKS`, `MOKPETRO_TRUCKS`)
- **Option B:** Single sheet with company column filter
- **Option C:** Database integration for sensitive data

## Testing Changes
After making these changes:
1. The tanker image should now load properly in both environments
2. "SCT" and "ROW" keywords will not be mistakenly treated as truck IDs
3. The summary will include gatepass information for multi-truck results
4. ✅ Company users can access their fleet data securely using `CO <company>`
5. ✅ Admin has access to all company data
